Thanks for purchasing Blood And Gore!

We made the blood to be used in our own game currently under development and decided to share it with others.

It has two important features.

 1. Each blood decal can be static batched since each blood group shares the same Material, just make sure they are from the same blood group.
 	The same goes for the Models. They all share the same material and can be combined. This will help you use much more blood and keep draw calls down.
 2. You can adjust the tint in the shader for each material to create different variations or to get the color just right for your game.

Note: We have provided prefabs each blood type (human, zombie alien) for your convenience, if you don't need a particular blood type, you can safely delete the blood group folder.
For instance, if you are making a zombie game and you don't want Alien blood (green blood) in your game, you can delete the AlienBloodDecalGroup1 and AlienBloodDecalGroup2 folders.

If you have any questions or feedback please feel free to reach out!
